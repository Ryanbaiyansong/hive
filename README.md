Clicksteam data records the flow or trail of a user when he/she visits a website. For example, if you have pages A-Z and want to see how many people land on Page G and then go to Page B - you can analyze this data and see the clickstream pattern of your visitors. This data is stored in semi structured web logs. Often you will hear the term web log analysis - this is the same as analyzing clickstream data. Segmenting, and analyzing this clickstream data will give you a more refined look at your customer's behavior patterns - from the time they land on your website till the time they either buy your product or leave without buying. 

You have built a wonderful website and your transaction page has all the information that is required for someone to know before buying the product. Still you see that a huge number of your website visitors leave before buying a single product. This is because of a broken link or path somewhere which prevents users to quickly and easily buy your product. Hadoop helps you to extract, store and analyze the clickstream data or web log data and merge it with the traditional customer data - in order to get better insights into the behavior of the visitor and optimize the path to product buying.
